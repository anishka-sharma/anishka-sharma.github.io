## The problem of matching job descriptions and resumes using machine learning algorithms to output a Skill Match Index in percentage involves several complex tasks, including data cleaning and preparation, feature extraction, algorithm selection and training, and metric evaluation. It is a challenging problem that requires expertise in NLP, machine learning, and data science, as well as a deep understanding of the job market and hiring practices and we hope to increase the performance of the ATS system with help of new technologies in NLP.
